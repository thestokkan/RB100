# Low or Nothing
#
# In the following code, numbers isn't mutated because #select isn't a destructive method. However, there is a destructive version of #select named #select!. Modify the code to use #select! instead of #select.
#
numbers = {
  high:   100,
  medium: 50,
  low:    10
}

low_numbers = numbers.select! do |key, value|
                 value < 25
               end

p low_numbers
p numbers
#
# Expected output:
#
# {low: 10}
# {low: 10}


# Answer (CORRECT):
# Changed #select to #select!
